      <h3>WHAT DOES STAR MARKETING DO?</h3>
      <P>
        <img src="images/strategies.jpg" alt="My test site">
        Star marketing is a strategic company that takes an ordinary business and turn it into one of the big players in the industry of business. We do this through:
         <h4>1. Social media.</h4>
         <img src="images/social.jpg" alt="My test image">
          <H4>2. Internet.</H4>
          <img src="images/internet.png" alt="My test image">
         <h4>3.The old fashion way:</h4>
         <img src="images/no-3.png" atl="My test image"> 
         which is having our people on the ground distributing flyers; this is because not everyone has social media or internet.
        <h4>4. We look on your income and expenditure:</h4> in this way we are able to see where the problem is exactly for example: the problem may be the income, how so you ask? Well the answer is that sometimes business run on survival mode where there’s  no much profit and by profit I refer to the money after all the deductions including the salaries, tax, and stock (if applicable).
        <img src="images/income-expenditure1.jpg" atl="My test image">  
        <h4>the 5th and final one is communication and connecting:</h4> what is this you may ask?, ‘communication and connecting’ is a business community. Where all both small and large businesses meet, share and advice each other on how to grow a business. Hear from people who once been in your shoes, avoid to make the very same business mistakes as they did and save time and money. STAR MARKETING: YOU ARE NEVER ALONE. 
 <strong>REMEMBER: TOGETHER WE GROW, EXPAND AND CONQUER</strong></P>
